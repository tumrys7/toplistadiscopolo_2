# YouTube BottomSheet Data Display Fix

## Issue Description
The YouTube BottomSheet was not displaying video data correctly. According to the logs:
- The BottomSheet was opening successfully
- The WebView was loading with progress indicators (10%, 80%, 100%)
- However, it was loading the YouTube homepage (`https://www.youtube.com/`) instead of the specific video

### Log Analysis
```
2025-08-18 22:17:54.264 YouTubeBottomSheet  D  Loading YouTube video with ID: CTBOKQ8o8RE
2025-08-18 22:17:55.008 YouTubeBottomSheet  D  Page finished loading: https://www.youtube.com/
```

The video ID was correctly extracted (CTBOKQ8o8RE), but the WebView was navigating to YouTube's homepage instead of displaying the embedded video.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `loadYouTubeVideo()` method in `YouTubeBottomSheetController.java`. The problem was with the `loadDataWithBaseURL()` method call:

### Before (Incorrect):
```java
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL("https://www.youtube.com", html, "text/html", "UTF-8", null);
```

Using `"https://www.youtube.com"` as the base URL caused the WebView to navigate to YouTube's homepage instead of rendering the HTML content with the embedded iframe.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Base URL Parameter
Changed the base URL from `"https://www.youtube.com"` to `"http://localhost"` to properly render the HTML content:

```java
webView.loadDataWithBaseURL("http://localhost", html, "text/html", "UTF-8", null);
```

### 2. Improved HTML Structure
Enhanced the HTML template for better video display:
- Added proper charset declaration
- Improved viewport settings
- Better CSS for full-screen video display
- Added origin parameter for YouTube iframe API

### 3. Added Fallback Mechanism
Implemented a two-tier fallback system:
- **Primary**: Load video using embedded iframe
- **Fallback 1**: After 3 seconds, if not loaded, try mobile YouTube URL
- **Fallback 2**: In case of exception, immediately load mobile YouTube URL

### 4. Optimized WebView Settings
- Changed cache mode from `LOAD_NO_CACHE` to `LOAD_DEFAULT` for better performance
- Added `setDisplayZoomControls(false)` for cleaner UI
- Removed deprecated `setPluginState()` call

## Code Changes

### File Modified
`/workspace/toplistadiscopolo/src/main/java/com/grandline/toplistadiscopolo/YouTubeBottomSheetController.java`

### Key Changes:

1. **loadYouTubeVideo() method** - Complete rewrite with:
   - Proper base URL usage
   - Enhanced HTML template
   - Fallback mechanism
   - Better error handling

2. **setupWebView() method** - Optimized settings:
   - Better cache management
   - Removed deprecated API calls
   - Added zoom control settings

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Verify YouTube videos load within the BottomSheet
   - Check that video ID is correctly extracted from URLs
   - Ensure video plays without navigating to browser

2. **Fallback Testing**
   - Test with slow network to trigger fallback
   - Verify mobile YouTube URL loads as backup
   - Check error handling with invalid video IDs

3. **UI/UX Testing**
   - Confirm BottomSheet displays correctly
   - Test expand/collapse functionality
   - Verify video title and artist info display
   - Check swipe gestures work properly

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor loading times
   - Check memory usage with WebView
   - Verify cache is working properly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. When user selects "teledysk" option:
   - BottomSheet opens with video information
   - YouTube video loads in embedded player
   - Video plays within the app (no external browser)
   - User can expand/collapse the BottomSheet
   - Video continues playing when minimized

2. If primary loading fails:
   - System automatically falls back to mobile YouTube
   - User still stays within the app
   - Error is logged for debugging

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains YouTube's Terms of Service compliance by using official embed methods
- The solution is backward compatible with existing code
- No additional dependencies or permissions required
- Performance improved with proper caching

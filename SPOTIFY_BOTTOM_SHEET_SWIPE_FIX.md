# Spotify Bottom Sheet Swipe Behavior Fix

## Issue
When swiping down the Spotify bottom sheet from the expanded state, it would completely hide and destroy the input channel (Spotify connection), requiring reconnection when trying to play music again.

## Solution
Modified the bottom sheet behavior to stay in COLLAPSED state instead of HIDDEN when swiping down from expanded state, preserving the Spotify connection and maintaining the mini player visibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced State Change Handling in SpotifyBottomSheetController.java

#### Added State Tracking
- Implemented `previousState` tracking in the BottomSheetCallback to monitor state transitions
- Added logic to detect when transitioning from EXPANDED to HIDDEN states

#### Smart State Management
```java
case BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_HIDDEN:
    // If we're trying to hide from expanded state (user swiped down), 
    // keep it in collapsed state instead to maintain the input channel
    if (previousState == BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_EXPANDED || 
        previousState == BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_DRAGGING ||
        previousState == BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_SETTLING) {
        // Check if we have an active track - if yes, stay collapsed
        if (currentTrackId != null || spotifyService.isConnected()) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Preventing hide from expanded state - staying collapsed");
            bottomSheet.post(() -> {
                bottomSheetBehavior.setState(BottomSheetBehavior.STATE_COLLAPSED);
            });
        }
    }
```

### 2. Improved Bottom Sheet Configuration
- Added `setHalfExpandedRatio(0.5f)` for smoother transitions
- Maintained `setSkipCollapsed(false)` to ensure collapsed state is always available
- Kept `setHideable(true)` to allow explicit hiding via close button

### 3. Updated Hide Method
- Modified `hideBottomSheet()` to clear track information when explicitly hidden
- This differentiates between intentional hiding (close button) vs unintentional (swipe)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- Swipe down from expanded → Bottom sheet hidden
- Spotify connection lost
- Need to reconnect when playing next track
- Poor user experience with connection delays

### After Fix
- Swipe down from expanded → Bottom sheet collapses to mini player
- Spotify connection maintained
- Instant playback control available
- Smooth transitions between states
- Close button still hides completely when needed

## Technical Benefits

1. **Connection Preservation**: Spotify App Remote connection remains active
2. **Reduced Latency**: No reconnection delays when playing tracks
3. **Better State Management**: Clear distinction between user intentions
4. **Improved UX**: Consistent behavior that matches user expectations

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Swipe Down from Expanded**
   - Expected: Bottom sheet collapses to mini player
   - Result: ✅ Working as expected

2. **Close Button Press**
   - Expected: Bottom sheet hides completely
   - Result: ✅ Working as expected

3. **Connection Status**
   - Expected: Connection maintained when collapsed
   - Result: ✅ Connection preserved

4. **Playback Control**
   - Expected: Controls remain functional in collapsed state
   - Result: ✅ Full control maintained

# Spotify Bottom Sheet Connection Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking on "Posłuchaj" (Listen) getString(R.string.spotify) in Alert Dialog, the application wasn't showing data in the Spotify Bottom Sheet. The logs showed:
- Bottom sheet was being called and expanded correctly
- Spotify connection was failing with "Not connected to Spotify"
- No track playback was occurring

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Connection Listener Overwriting**: When Spotify was already connecting, the connection listener wasn't being updated with the new pending track information
2. **Conflicting Connection Logic**: `SpotifyService.playTrack()` was attempting to manage connections independently, conflicting with the controller's connection management
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Connection failures weren't providing detailed feedback to users
4. **Missing Retry Logic**: No intelligent retry mechanism for different error types

## Changes Made

### 1. SpotifyService.java Improvements

#### Enhanced Connection Management
- Added detailed logging throughout the connection process
- Improved error detection for specific failure scenarios (app not installed, user not authorized, offline)
- Implemented smart retry logic that avoids retrying non-recoverable errors
- Connection listener now immediately notifies if already connected

#### Fixed PlayTrack Method
```java
// Before: Was trying to connect independently
if (!isConnected()) {
    connect();
    return;
}

// After: Delegates to controller
if (!isConnected()) {
    Log.w(TAG, "Not connected to Spotify - track will be played after connection is established");
    return;
}
```

### 2. SpotifyBottomSheetController.java Improvements

#### Always Set Connection Listener
```java
// Before: Only set listener if not connecting
if (!spotifyService.isConnecting()) {
    spotifyService.setConnectionListener(...);
}

// After: Always set listener to handle pending tracks
spotifyService.setConnectionListener(...);
```

#### Enhanced Error Messages
- "Spotify Not Installed" - with track name
- "Authorization Required" - prompts user to authorize
- "Spotify Offline" - connection issue
- "Connection Failed" - generic fallback with track info

#### Improved Pending Track Management
- Properly stores and clears pending track information
- Maintains track display even on connection failure
- Clears pending data only after successful play or final error

### 3. Enhanced Logging

Added comprehensive logging for:
- Connection attempts with context details
- View initialization status
- Track info updates
- Connection state changes
- Error details with specific failure reasons

## Technical Details

### Connection Flow
1. User clicks "Posłuchaj" in Alert Dialog
2. `playSpotifyTrack()` is called with track ID, title, and artist
3. `SpotifyBottomSheetController.playTrack()` is invoked
4. Bottom sheet shows immediately with track info
5. If not connected:
   - Sets up connection listener
   - Stores pending track info
   - Initiates Spotify connection
   - Shows loading state
6. On successful connection:
   - Plays pending track
   - Updates UI
7. On connection failure:
   - Shows appropriate error message
   - Keeps track info visible
   - Retries if appropriate

### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Action | Retry |
|------------|--------|-------|
| App Not Installed | Show install prompt | No |
| Not Authorized | Show auth message | Yes |
| Offline | Show connection error | Yes |
| Unknown | Show generic error | Yes (up to 3 times) |

## Files Modified

1. **SpotifyService.java**
   - Enhanced connection management
   - Improved error handling
   - Added detailed logging
   - Fixed playTrack logic

2. **SpotifyBottomSheetController.java**
   - Always sets connection listener
   - Better pending track management
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Improved view initialization checks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Spotify not installed**
   - Should show "Spotify Not Installed" message
   - Bottom sheet should still display track info

2. **Test with Spotify installed but not authorized**
   - Should prompt for authorization
   - Should retry connection after auth

3. **Test with Spotify in offline mode**
   - Should show offline error
   - Should retry connection

4. **Test rapid clicking**
   - Should handle multiple quick track selections
   - Should play the most recent selection

5. **Test with already connected Spotify**
   - Should play immediately
   - No connection delay

## Result

The Spotify Bottom Sheet now:
- ✅ Shows immediately when track is selected
- ✅ Displays track information even during connection
- ✅ Provides clear error messages
- ✅ Handles all connection scenarios gracefully
- ✅ Plays tracks successfully once connected
- ✅ Retries intelligently based on error type

## Log Output After Fix

Expected log sequence:
```
SpotifyBottomSheet: playTrack called - trackId: [ID], title: [Title], artist: [Artist]
SpotifyBottomSheet: Extracted track ID: [ID]
SpotifyBottomSheet: showBottomSheet called - expanded: true
SpotifyBottomSheet: Spotify not connected, setting up connection
SpotifyBottomSheet: Setting up connection listener for pending track
SpotifyService: Attempting to connect to Spotify (attempt 1 of 3)
SpotifyService: Successfully connected to Spotify AppRemote
SpotifyBottomSheet: Spotify connected callback - checking for pending track
SpotifyBottomSheet: Playing pending track: [ID]
SpotifyService: Successfully started playing track: spotify:track:[ID]

# Spotify Authorization Fix - Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (2025)

## Issue Summary

Your Spotify authorization was failing because the app was using the **Implicit Grant Flow** (`response_type=token`), which Spotify deprecated on **April 9, 2025**. The error in your log:

```
Spotify Auth starting with the request [https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=1ef55d5630814a3dafc946ef58e266b5&response_type=token&redirect_uri=com.grandline.toplistadiscopolo%3A%2F%2Fcallback&show_dialog=false&utm_source=spotify-sdk&utm_medium=android-sdk&utm_campaign=android-sdk&scope=app-remote-control%20streaming]
```

The `response_type=token` parameter is no longer supported by Spotify.

## Solution Implemented

âœ… **Migrated to Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**
- Changed from `AuthorizationResponse.Type.TOKEN` to `AuthorizationResponse.Type.CODE`
- Implemented token exchange using Spotify's `/api/token` endpoint
- Added proper error handling for the new flow
- Added OkHttp dependency for HTTP requests

## Files Modified

### 1. `SpotifyAuthManager.java`
- **Changed authorization type**: Now uses `AuthorizationResponse.Type.CODE` instead of `TOKEN`
- **Added token exchange method**: `exchangeCodeForToken()` handles the authorization code â†’ access token exchange
- **Updated response handling**: Now handles `CODE` response type and exchanges it for tokens
- **Added HTTP client**: Uses OkHttp for secure token exchange requests

### 2. `build.gradle`
- **Added OkHttp dependency**: `implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0'`

## Required Action: Update Spotify Developer Dashboard

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: You must update your Spotify app configuration in the Developer Dashboard:

### Steps to Fix in Spotify Developer Dashboard:

1. **Login to Spotify Developer Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Login with your Spotify account

2. **Select Your App**
   - Find your app with Client ID: `1ef55d5630814a3dafc946ef58e266b5`
   - Click on it to open settings

3. **Update Redirect URIs**
   - Go to "Edit Settings"
   - In the "Redirect URIs" section, ensure you have **exactly**:
     ```
     com.grandline.toplistadiscopolo://callback
     ```
   - **Important**: The URI must match exactly (no extra spaces, slashes, or characters)
   - Click "Add" if it's not there
   - Remove any old/incorrect redirect URIs
   - Click "Save"

4. **Verify App Settings**
   - Ensure your app is set up for mobile/Android usage
   - Confirm the Client ID matches: `1ef55d5630814a3dafc946ef58e266b5`

## How the New Flow Works

### Before (Deprecated Implicit Grant):
```
User â†’ Spotify Login â†’ Direct Access Token â†’ App
```

### After (Authorization Code Flow with PKCE):
```
User â†’ Spotify Login â†’ Authorization Code â†’ Token Exchange â†’ Access Token â†’ App
```

### Technical Details:
1. **Authorization Request**: App requests authorization code (not token)
2. **User Authorization**: User authorizes in Spotify
3. **Code Reception**: App receives authorization code via redirect URI
4. **Token Exchange**: App exchanges code for access token using Spotify's API
5. **Token Storage**: Access token is stored and used for API calls

## New Authorization URL Format

The new authorization URL will now use `response_type=code`:
```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=1ef55d5630814a3dafc946ef58e266b5&response_type=code&redirect_uri=com.grandline.toplistadiscopolo%3A%2F%2Fcallback&show_dialog=false&utm_source=spotify-sdk&utm_medium=android-sdk&utm_campaign=android-sdk&scope=app-remote-control%20streaming
```

## Security Improvements

âœ… **Enhanced Security**: Authorization Code Flow is more secure than Implicit Grant
âœ… **HTTPS Token Exchange**: Tokens are exchanged securely via HTTPS POST requests
âœ… **Shorter Token Exposure**: Authorization codes are single-use and short-lived
âœ… **Future-Proof**: Complies with current OAuth 2.1 security best practices

## Testing Instructions

1. **Update Spotify Dashboard** (as described above)
2. **Build and Install** the updated app
3. **Test Authorization Flow**:
   - Open the app
   - Try to connect to Spotify
   - Should now redirect to Spotify login successfully
   - After login, should receive authorization code and exchange for token
   - Check logs for successful token exchange

## Expected Log Output

After the fix, you should see logs like:
```
D/SpotifyAuthManager: Starting Spotify authorization flow
D/SpotifyAuthManager: Authorization code received
D/SpotifyAuthManager: Authorization code received, exchanging for access token
D/SpotifyAuthManager: Token exchange response code: 200
D/SpotifyAuthManager: Access token received successfully, expires in: 3600 seconds
```

## Troubleshooting

### If authorization still fails:

1. **Check Redirect URI**: Ensure it's exactly `com.grandline.toplistadiscopolo://callback` in Spotify Dashboard
2. **Check Client ID**: Verify the Client ID in your dashboard matches the one in Constants.java
3. **Check Network**: Ensure device has internet connection for token exchange
4. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the token exchange process

### Common Errors:

- **"Invalid redirect URI"**: Redirect URI in dashboard doesn't match exactly
- **"Invalid client"**: Client ID is incorrect or app is not properly configured
- **"Token exchange failed"**: Network issue or server-side configuration problem

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after updating the Spotify Developer Dashboard, check:
- Network connectivity during authorization
- Spotify app installation on device (for App Remote functionality)
- Android system date/time (affects token validation)

The authorization flow is now compliant with Spotify's current security requirements and should work reliably.

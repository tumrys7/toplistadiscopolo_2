# Fix: Spotify Bottom Sheet Not Showing on AlertDialog Click

## Issue Description
When users clicked the "Posłuchaj" (Listen) option in the AlertDialog, the Spotify Bottom Sheet was not appearing. The logs showed:
```
SpotifyService: Already connected or connecting to Spotify
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred when the SpotifyService was in a "connecting" state (`isConnecting = true`):

1. The `connect()` method would return early without setting up a new connection listener
2. The bottom sheet's callback to show itself would never be triggered
3. Users would click the option but nothing would happen visually

## Solution Implemented

### 1. SpotifyService.java Changes
Modified the `connect()` method to handle three distinct states:

```java
public void connect() {
    // If already connected, notify listener immediately
    if (isConnected()) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Already connected to Spotify");
        if (connectionListener != null) {
            connectionListener.onConnected();
        }
        return;
    }
    
    // If already connecting, allow setting new listener but prevent duplicate connections
    if (isConnecting) {
        Log.d(TAG, "Already connecting to Spotify");
        return;
    }
    
    // Proceed with normal connection...
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- Immediately notifies listeners if already connected
- Allows setting new listeners even when connecting
- Prevents duplicate connection attempts

### 2. SpotifyBottomSheetController.java Changes
Simplified the `playTrack()` method to always set up listeners before connecting:

```java
public void playTrack(String spotifyTrackId, String title, String artist) {
    // Store track info
    this.currentTrackId = spotifyTrackId;
    this.currentTrackTitle = title;
    this.currentTrackArtist = artist;
    
    // Update UI immediately
    updateTrackInfo(title, artist);
    
    // Always set up connection listener
    spotifyService.setConnectionListener(new SpotifyConnectionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onConnected() {
            spotifyService.playTrack(spotifyTrackId);
            showBottomSheet(true);
        }
        // ... error handling
    });
    
    // Connect (will notify immediately if already connected)
    spotifyService.connect();
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- Removes complex conditional logic
- Always sets up listeners before connecting
- Leverages the improved `connect()` method behavior

### 3. ListaPrzebojowDiscoPolo.java Enhancements
Added defensive programming and debugging capabilities:

```java
public void playSpotifyTrack(String spotifyTrackId, String title, String artist) {
    Log.d("SpotifyDebug", "playSpotifyTrack called - trackId: " + spotifyTrackId);
    
    // Auto-reinitialize if controller is null
    if (spotifyBottomSheetController == null) {
        Log.e("SpotifyDebug", "Controller is null! Reinitializing...");
        ViewGroup rootView = findViewById(R.id.root);
        if (rootView != null) {
            spotifyBottomSheetController = new SpotifyBottomSheetController(this, rootView);
        }
    }
    
    // Proceed with playback
    if (spotifyBottomSheetController != null && spotifyTrackId != null) {
        spotifyBottomSheetController.playTrack(spotifyTrackId, title, artist);
    }
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- Null safety checks
- Automatic reinitialization if needed
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Scenarios
The fix handles all connection states properly:

| Scenario | Before Fix | After Fix |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Spotify not connected | Works | Works |
| Spotify already connected | Works | Works |
| Spotify currently connecting | **Bottom sheet doesn't show** | ✅ **Bottom sheet shows after connection** |
| Multiple rapid clicks | Inconsistent behavior | Consistent behavior |

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: Bottom sheet always appears when it should
2. **User Experience**: No more "dead clicks" that do nothing
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more predictable code flow
4. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- `SpotifyService.java` - Connection handling logic
- `SpotifyBottomSheetController.java` - Simplified playback initiation
- `ListaPrzebojowDiscoPolo.java` - Added safety checks and logging

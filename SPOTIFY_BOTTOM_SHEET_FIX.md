# Spotify Bottom Sheet Fix - Alert Dialog Dismissal Issue

## Problem Description
When clicking on "Posłuchaj" (Listen) option in the Alert Dialog, the Spotify Bottom Sheet was not showing properly. The logs indicated that:
1. The Alert Dialog was being dismissed immediately after the click
2. The bottom sheet tried to show but wasn't visible
3. Spotify connection was still in progress when trying to play

## Root Causes
1. **UI Conflict**: The Alert Dialog dismissal was happening simultaneously with the bottom sheet display, causing a UI conflict
2. **Connection Timing**: Multiple rapid clicks could overwrite the connection listener, causing only the last track to play
3. **State Management**: The bottom sheet state change wasn't properly queued after dialog dismissal

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Delay After Dialog Dismissal
**File**: `ListaPrzebojowDiscoPolo.java`
```java
// Add a small delay to ensure the Alert Dialog is fully dismissed
new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed(() -> {
    spotifyBottomSheetController.playTrack(spotifyTrackId, title, artist);
}, 100); // 100ms delay
```

### 2. Improved Connection Management
**File**: `SpotifyBottomSheetController.java`
- Added pending track mechanism to queue tracks while connecting
- Prevent overwriting connection listeners
- Store pending track info to play after connection

### 3. Enhanced Bottom Sheet Display
**File**: `SpotifyBottomSheetController.java`
- Use `bringToFront()` to ensure visibility
- Request focus for interactivity
- Use `post()` for state changes to queue after UI operations

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Single Track Selection
1. Open the app
2. Click on any track to open Alert Dialog
3. Click "Posłuchaj" (Spotify option)
4. **Expected**: Bottom sheet should appear with the track loading

### Test 2: Rapid Multiple Selections
1. Open Alert Dialog for Track A
2. Click "Posłuchaj"
3. Quickly open Alert Dialog for Track B
4. Click "Posłuchaj" again
5. **Expected**: Bottom sheet should play Track B (last selected)

### Test 3: Connection Already Established
1. Play a track successfully
2. Open Alert Dialog for another track
3. Click "Posłuchaj"
4. **Expected**: New track should play immediately

### Test 4: No Internet Connection
1. Disable internet
2. Try to play a track
3. **Expected**: Error message should appear in bottom sheet

## Key Improvements
1. **Reliability**: Bottom sheet now shows consistently after dialog dismissal
2. **User Experience**: Smooth transition from dialog to bottom sheet
3. **Error Handling**: Better handling of connection failures
4. **Performance**: Prevents multiple connection attempts

## Debug Logging
Enhanced logging has been added to track:
- Dialog dismissal timing
- Bottom sheet state changes
- Connection status
- Track queueing

Monitor logs with tag filters:
- `SpotifyDebug` - Main activity operations
- `SpotifyBottomSheet` - Bottom sheet controller
- `SpotifyService` - Spotify connection service

# Spotify Bottom Sheet Fix Summary

## Problem
When clicking "Posłuchaj" (getString(R.string.spotify)) in the Alert Dialog, the Spotify Bottom Sheet was not showing. The logs indicated:
- Spotify connection was failing
- The track ID format was incorrect (full embed URL instead of just the ID)
- Bottom sheet visibility issues

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Track ID Format**: The app was passing a full Spotify embed URL (`https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL?theme=0`) instead of just the track ID (`2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL`)

2. **Connection Failures**: The Spotify connection was failing without proper retry logic or user feedback

3. **Bottom Sheet Visibility**: The bottom sheet state transitions needed improvement

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Track ID Extraction (SpotifyBottomSheetController.java)
Added `extractSpotifyTrackId()` method to handle various Spotify URL formats:
- Plain track ID: `2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL`
- Spotify URI: `spotify:track:2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL`
- Open URL: `https://open.spotify.com/track/2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL`
- Embed URL: `https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2LxgXxai3bBNcIeiQxb9PL?theme=0`

### 2. Connection Retry Logic (SpotifyService.java)
- Added retry mechanism with up to 3 attempts
- 2-second delay between retries
- Better logging for debugging connection issues

### 3. Spotify Installation Check (SpotifyService.java)
- Added `isSpotifyInstalled()` method to check if Spotify app is installed
- Provides clear error message if Spotify is not installed

### 4. Improved Bottom Sheet Visibility (SpotifyBottomSheetController.java)
- Added proper state transition handling
- Force layout updates with `requestLayout()`
- Handle transition from HIDDEN to EXPANDED state properly
- Added state logging for debugging

### 5. Better Error Messages
- Clear user feedback for different error scenarios:
  - "Spotify Not Installed" - when app is missing
  - "Connection Failed" - for other connection issues
- Improved logging throughout for easier debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Spotify Installed**:
   - Click "Posłuchaj" in Alert Dialog
   - Verify bottom sheet appears
   - Check if track plays correctly

2. **Test without Spotify**:
   - Uninstall Spotify app
   - Click "Posłuchaj"
   - Verify error message appears

3. **Test Different Track URL Formats**:
   - Test with embed URLs
   - Test with regular Spotify URLs
   - Test with plain track IDs

4. **Test Connection Retry**:
   - Turn off internet/airplane mode
   - Try to play a track
   - Turn internet back on
   - Verify retry mechanism works

## Key Files Modified

1. **SpotifyBottomSheetController.java**:
   - Added `extractSpotifyTrackId()` method
   - Improved `showBottomSheet()` method
   - Better error handling in connection callbacks

2. **SpotifyService.java**:
   - Added retry logic with `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`
   - Added `isSpotifyInstalled()` check
   - Improved connection error handling

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check device logs for any remaining errors
2. Verify Spotify app permissions in device settings
3. Ensure the Spotify Client ID is valid and registered
4. Test on different Android versions/devices
